# Arduino C
## Remotly-Car-project
It's a Mobile Controlled Car , The car allow easy driving with obstacles avoidance, accurate movement


## project phases:

### Phase 1: Easy Driving Application

- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in easy driving mode.
- User can control car movement using mobile.
- User can move the car forward, backward, left and right.
- The car should avoid obstacles. 
- The minimum requirements of obstacle avoidance is stop to avoid collision.
- Bonus, for better avoidance techniques.

### Phase 2: Line Tracking Application

- Students should prepare set of connected white sheets (2m x 2m) and draw track over it.
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in line tracking mode.
- When the car placed over the track it should follow the line.
- The minimum requirements is to use simple closed track.
- Bonus, for complex tracks with crossing points and sharp curves of radius less than 25 cm.

### Phase 3: Accurate Movement Application

- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in accurate movement mode.
- Use can order the car to move forward or backward for certain length (EX 40 cm).
- Use can order the car to move right with proper angle (EX 30 degree).
- User orders is sent via the Blueooth module.
- While demo the car should move in infinity shape then rectangle shape then circle shape.
- The car should return to beginning point after finishing each shape.
- The car should stop for 25 seconds after finishing each shape.
- The shape size must be (2m x 2m) no more no less.
